palyer.java class 
    -> describe the player (user score + methods)
round.java class
    -> describe the round it should have (drawer  + round number + word to guess + storke + needed methods) 
    -> round will implemet the drawer the round number etc.....
gameState.java class
    -> the main logic of the game -> have (players + round instance + round + words to geuss....)
gameServer.java class
    -> start server or open new socket and allows clients to connect needs port number
    -> it use threads to handle multiple player for example if two clients geuss word at same time + connect at same time
    -> thread ? A thread is like a separate worker inside your program.
    -> for each player we create its thread
    -> future improvment + use mutex to avoid race condition
playerHandler.java class
    -> handler the  online player 
    -> it brodcast the round informations to player + score + check geuss + brodcast the storke
gameClient.java class
    -> conect to server + read msg from server and execute call back from the gameController or LoginController + sends  msg to server + disconnet
LoginController.java class
    -> load the login screen + check input + load the game screen
 

Example: Player “Alice” joins the game and draws while “Bob” guesses

Alice starts the client and enters her username:
LoginController.connectToServer() creates a GameClient instance.
GameClient.connect() opens a socket to the server (localhost:5000) and starts the listener thread (startListening()).
Server accepts Alice’s connection:
GameServer.start() calls serverSocket.accept() → returns a Socket.
A new PlayerHandler instance is created for Alice: new PlayerHandler(socket, gameState, this).
new Thread(handler).start() → runs handler.run() in a separate thread.
Alice sends her username to the server:
GameClient.send(username) writes to the server socket.
On the server, PlayerHandler.run() reads it: in.readLine().
A Player object is created for Alice, added to GameState.players.
The server broadcasts "Alice has joined the game!" using server.broadcast().
Game starts a round:
If no round exists, GameState.startNextRound() is called.
A random word is chosen and a Round object is created.
PlayerHandler.broadcastRoundStart() sends round info to all players:
Drawer sees the word (e.g., Alice is the drawer and sees "apple").
Guessers see only the drawer’s name.
Alice draws on the canvas:
GameController mouse events capture positions (lastX, lastY).
Each stroke sends "STROKE:x1,y1,x2,y2" via GameClient.send().
Server PlayerHandler.handleStroke() receives it, updates Round.drawingData, and broadcasts to all other players except Alice.
Bob’s GameClient listener receives "STROKE:x1,y1,x2,y2", triggers the callback in GameController, and draws the line on his canvas.
Bob guesses the word:
Bob types in guessField → GameController sends "GUESS:apple".
Server PlayerHandler.run() receives it, calls handleGuess().
GameState.checkGuess() compares the guess with the word.
If correct:
Alice (drawer) gets 50 points, Bob (guesser) gets 100 points.
Server broadcasts score updates (SCORE_UPDATE) and possibly starts a new round.
Game continues:
The above steps repeat for each round.
At the end of 5 rounds, server broadcasts "GAME_OVER" and leaderboard.
GameController.showLeaderboard() displays it, offering to play again or e
